# I confused about the main title of this lesson , what is he mean with Hops ?

Great question, Mohamed! In the context of networking, "hops" refers to the number of intermediate devices or routers that a packet of data must pass through to reach its destination. Each time a packet passes through a router, it is considered a hop.

Think of it like this: when you send a letter through the postal service, it may need to pass through multiple post offices before reaching its final destination. Each post office is like a router, and each time the letter moves from one post office to another, it is considered a hop.

Similarly, in networking, when data is transmitted from one device to another over the internet, it often needs to pass through several routers or intermediate devices. Each time it passes through a router, it is considered a hop.

The number of hops can affect the speed and efficiency of data transmission. Fewer hops generally mean faster transmission, as there are fewer intermediate devices to process the data. It's an important concept to understand when optimizing network performance.

# What is mtr command ?

The `mtr` command stands for "My Traceroute." It is a network diagnostic tool that combines the functionality of both `ping` and `traceroute`.

When you run the `mtr` command, it continuously sends packets to a destination IP address and displays the round-trip time (RTT) and packet loss for each intermediate hop. It provides real-time information about the network path between your computer and the destination.

The `mtr` command is useful for troubleshooting network connectivity issues. It helps identify where network problems occur by showing the latency and packet loss at each hop. This information can be valuable in pinpointing network bottlenecks or identifying problematic routers.

To use `mtr`, you typically provide the destination IP address or domain name as an argument. For example, you can run `mtr google.com` to trace the network path to Google's servers.

Keep in mind that `mtr` may not be available by default on all operating systems. However, you can usually install it using package managers like `apt` or `yum` on Linux distributions

# proxies

Proxies are an important concept in networking and web development. They act as intermediaries between clients (such as web browsers) and servers. When a client sends a request to a server, it can go through a proxy instead of directly reaching the server.

A web proxy works at the HTTP level, meaning it handles HTTP requests and responses. It takes queries from browsers and sends them out to web servers. Proxies can be used for various purposes, such as caching, filtering, or load balancing.

One common use of web proxies is caching. When a client requests a web page, the proxy can store a copy of the page. If another client requests the same page, the proxy can serve it directly from its cache instead of fetching it from the server again. This can improve performance and reduce network traffic.

Proxies can also be used for filtering content. For example, organizations may use proxies to block access to certain websites or to monitor and log web traffic. Proxies can inspect the requests and responses passing through them and apply rules or policies based on the content.

From the perspective of a web developer or site operator, traffic from a busy proxy looks similar to traffic from a busy NAT (Network Address Translation). Both involve multiple users on different computers accessing the internet through a single public IP address.

# so what is the different between proxy and firewall ?

Great question! While both proxies and firewalls are network security components, they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of the network stack.

A firewall is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between an internal network (such as a company's network) and the external network (such as the internet). Firewalls can inspect packets at the network and transport layers (IP and TCP/UDP) and make decisions on whether to allow or block traffic based on factors like source/destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol types.

On the other hand, a proxy is an intermediary server that sits between clients and servers, forwarding requests from clients to servers and returning responses back to clients. Proxies work at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPS) and can perform various functions such as caching, load balancing, content filtering, and anonymization. Proxies can be used to enhance security by adding an extra layer of protection between clients and servers.

To summarize, firewalls primarily focus on network traffic filtering and security, operating at lower layers of the network stack, while proxies operate at the application layer, providing additional functionality and control over client-server communication
